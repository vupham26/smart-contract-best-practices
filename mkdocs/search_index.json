            "text": "Ethereum and complex blockchain programs are new and highly experimental. Therefore, you should expect constant changes in the security landscape, as new bugs and security risks are discovered, and new best practices are developed. Following the security practices in this document is therefore only the beginning of the security work you will need to do as a smart contract developer.\n\n\nSmart contract programming requires a different engineering mindset than you may be used to. The cost of failure can be high, and change can be difficult, making it in some ways more similar to hardware programming or financial services programming than web or mobile development. It is therefore not enough to defend against known vulnerabilities. Instead, you will need to learn a new philosophy of development:\n\n\n\n\nPrepare for failure\n. Any non-trivial contract will have errors in it. Your code must, therefore, be able to respond to bugs and vulnerabilities gracefully.\n\n\nPause the contract when things are going wrong ('circuit breaker')\n\n\nManage the amount of money at risk (rate limiting, maximum usage)\n\n\n\n\nHave an effective upgrade path for bugfixes and improvements\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRollout carefully\n.\n It is always better to catch bugs before a full production release.\n\n\n\n\nTest contracts thoroughly, and add tests whenever new attack vectors are discovered\n\n\nProvide \nbug bounties\n starting from alpha testnet releases\n\n\n\n\nRollout in phases, with increasing usage and testing in each phase\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep contracts simple\n. Complexity increases the likelihood of errors.\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the contract logic is simple\n\n\nModularize code to keep contracts and functions small\n\n\nUse already-written tools or code where possible (eg. don't roll your own random number generator)\n\n\nPrefer clarity to performance whenever possible\n\n\n\n\nOnly use the blockchain for the parts of your system that require decentralization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay up to date\n. Use the resources listed in the next section to keep track of new security developments.\n\n\n\n\nCheck your contracts for any new bug that's discovered\n\n\nUpgrade to the latest version of any tool or library as soon as possible\n\n\n\n\nAdopt new security techniques that appear useful\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe aware of blockchain properties\n. While much of your programming experience will be relevant to Ethereum programming, there are some pitfalls to be aware of.\n\n\n\n\nBe extremely careful about external contract calls, which may execute malicious code and change control flow.\n\n\nUnderstand that your public functions are public, and may be called maliciously. Your private data is also viewable by anyone.\n\n\nKeep gas costs and the block gas limit in mind.\n\n\n\n\nFundamental Tradeoffs: Simplicity versus Complexity cases\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nThere are multiple fundamental tradeoffs to consider when assessing the structure and security of a smart contract system.  The general recommendation for any smart contract system is to identify the proper balance for these fundamental tradeoffs.\n\n\nAn ideal smart contract system from a software engineering bias is modular, reuses code instead of duplicating it, and supports upgradeable components.  An ideal smart contract system from a secure architecture bias may share this mindset, especially in the case of more complex smart contract systems.\n\n\nHowever, there are important exceptions where security and software engineering best practices may not be aligned.  In each case, the proper balance is obtained by identifying the optimal mix of properties along contract system dimensions such as:\n\n\n\n\nRigid versus Upgradeable\n\n\nMonolithic versus Modular\n\n\nDuplication versus Reuse\n\n\n\n\nRigid versus Upgradeable\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhile multiple resources, including this one, emphasize malleability characteristics such as Killable, Upgradeable or Modifiable patterns there is a \nfundamental tradeoff\n between malleability and security.\n\n\nMalleability patterns by definition add complexity and potential attack surfaces.  Simplicity is particularly effective over complexity in cases where the smart contract system performs a very limited set of functionality for a pre-defined limited period of time, for example, a governance-free finite-time-frame token-sale contract system.\n\n\nMonolithic versus Modular\n\u00b6\n\n\nA monolithic self-contained contract keeps all knowledge locally identifiable and readable.  While there are few smart contract systems held in high regard that exist as monoliths, there is an argument to be made for extreme locality of data and flow - for example, in the case of optimizing code review efficiency.\n\n\nAs with the other tradeoffs considered here, security best practices trend away from software engineering best practices in simple short-lived contracts and trend toward software engineering best practices in the case of more complex perpetual contract systems.\n\n\nDuplication versus Reuse\n\u00b6\n\n\nA smart contract system from a software engineering perspective wishes to maximize reuse where reasonable.

            "text": "This page demonstrates a number of solidity patterns which should generally be followed when writing smart contracts.\n\n\nExternal Calls\n\u00b6\n\n\nAvoid external calls when possible\n\u00b6\n\n\nCalls to untrusted contracts can introduce several unexpected risks or errors. External calls may execute malicious code in that contract \nor\n any other contract that it depends upon. As such, every external call should be treated as a potential security risk and removed if possible. When it is not possible to remove external calls, use the recommendations in the rest of this section to minimize the danger.\n\n\nBe aware of the tradeoffs between \nsend()\n, \ntransfer()\n, and \ncall.value()()\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhen sending Ether be aware of the relative tradeoffs between the use of\n\nsomeAddress.send()\n, \nsomeAddress.transfer()\n, and \nsomeAddress.call.value()()\n.\n\n\n\n\nx.transfer(y)\n is equivalent to \nrequire(x.send(y));\n Send is the low level counterpart of transfer, and it's advisable to use transfer when possible.\n\n\nsomeAddress.send()\nand \nsomeAddress.transfer()\n are considered \nsafe\n against \nreentrancy\n.\n    While these methods still trigger code execution, the called contract is\n    only given a stipend of 2,300 gas which is currently only enough to log an\n    event.\n\n\nsomeAddress.call.value()()\n will send the provided ether and trigger code\n    execution.  The executed code is given all available gas for execution\n    making this type of value transfer \nunsafe\n against reentrancy.\n\n\n\n\nUsing \nsend()\n or \ntransfer()\n will prevent reentrancy but it does so at the cost of being\nincompatible with any contract whose fallback function requires more than 2,300\ngas.\n\n\nOne pattern that attempts to balance this trade-off is to implement both\na \npush\n and \npull\n mechanism, using \nsend()\n or \ntransfer()\n\nfor the \npush\n component and \ncall.value()()\n for the \npull\n component.\n\n\nIt is worth pointing out that exclusive use of \nsend()\n or \ntransfer()\n for value transfers\ndoes not itself make a contract safe against reentrancy but only makes those\nspecific value transfers safe against reentrancy.\n\n\nHandle errors in external calls\n\u00b6\n\n\nSolidity offers low-level call methods that work on raw addresses: \naddress.call()\n, \naddress.callcode()\n, \naddress.delegatecall()\n, and \naddress.send()\n. These low-level methods never throw an exception, but will return \nfalse\n if the call encounters an exception. On the other hand, \ncontract calls\n (e.g., \nExternalContract.doSomething()\n) will automatically propagate a throw (for example, \nExternalContract.doSomething()\n will also \nthrow\n if \ndoSomething()\n throws).\n\n\nIf you choose to use the low-level call methods, make sure to handle the possibility that the call will fail, by checking the return value.\n\n\n// bad\n\n\nsomeAddress\n.\nsend\n(\n55\n);\n\n\nsomeAddress\n.\ncall\n.\nvalue\n(\n55\n)();\n \n// this is doubly dangerous, as it will forward all remaining gas and doesn't check for result\n\n\nsomeAddress\n.\ncall\n.\nvalue\n(\n100\n)(\nbytes4\n(\nsha3\n(\n\"deposit()\"\n)));\n \n// if deposit throws an exception, the raw call() will only return false and transaction will NOT be reverted\n\n\n\n// good\n\n\nif\n(\n!\nsomeAddress\n.\nsend\n(\n55\n))\n \n{\n\n    \n// Some failure code\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nExternalContract\n(\nsomeAddress\n).\ndeposit\n.\nvalue\n(\n100\n);\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't make control flow assumptions after external calls\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhether using \nraw calls\n or \ncontract calls\n, assume that malicious code will execute if \nExternalContract\n is untrusted. Even if \nExternalContract\n is not malicious, malicious code can be executed by any contracts \nit\n calls. One particular danger is malicious code may hijack the control flow, leading to race conditions. (See \nRace Conditions\n for a fuller discussion of this problem).\n\n\nFavor \npull\n over \npush\n for external calls\n\u00b6\n\n\nExternal calls can fail accidentally or deliberately. To minimize the damage caused by such failures, it is often better to isolate each external call into its own transaction that can be initiated by the recipient of the call. This is especially relevant for payments, where it is better to let users withdraw funds rather than push funds to them automatically. (This also reduces the chance of \nproblems with the gas limit\n.)  Avoid combining multiple \nsend()\n calls in a single transaction.\n\n\n// bad\n\n\ncontract\n \nauction\n \n{\n\n    \naddress\n \nhighestBidder\n;\n\n    \nuint\n \nhighestBid\n;\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nbid\n()\n \npayable\n \n{\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\nvalue\n \n>=\n \nhighestBid\n);\n\n\n        \nif\n \n(\nhighestBidder\n \n!=\n \n0\n)\n \n{\n\n            \nhighestBidder\n.\ntransfer\n(\nhighestBid\n);\n \n// if this call consistently fails, no one else can bid\n\n        \n}\n\n\n       \nhighestBidder\n \n=\n \nmsg\n.\nsender\n;\n\n       \nhighestBid\n \n=\n \nmsg\n.\nvalue\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n// good\n\n\ncontract\n \nauction\n \n{\n\n    \naddress\n \nhighestBidder\n;\n\n    \nuint\n \nhighestBid\n;\n\n    \nmapping\n(\naddress\n \n=>\n \nuint\n)\n \nrefunds\n;\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nbid\n()\n \npayable\n \nexternal\n \n{\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\nvalue\n \n>=\n \nhighestBid\n);\n\n\n        \nif\n \n(\nhighestBidder\n \n!=\n \n0\n)\n \n{\n\n            \nrefunds\n[\nhighestBidder\n]\n \n+=\n \nhighestBid\n;\n \n// record the refund that this user can claim\n\n        \n}\n\n\n        \nhighestBidder\n \n=\n \nmsg\n.\nsender\n;\n\n        \nhighestBid\n \n=\n \nmsg\n.\nvalue\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nwithdrawRefund\n()\n \nexternal\n \n{\n\n        \nuint\n \nrefund\n \n=\n \nrefunds\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n];\n\n        \nrefunds\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n=\n \n0\n;\n\n        \nmsg\n.\nsender\n.\ntransfer\n(\nrefund\n);\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nMark untrusted contracts\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhen interacting with external contracts, name your variables, methods, and contract interfaces in a way that makes it clear that interacting with them is potentially unsafe.

For example, the token to ether issuance ratio, in a token issuance contract, may be fixed. You can verify that this is the case at all times with an \nassert()\n. Assert guards should often be combined with other techniques, such as pausing the contract and allowing upgrades. (Otherwise, you may end up stuck, with an assertion that is always failing.)\n\n\nExample:\n\n\ncontract\n \nToken\n \n{\n\n    \nmapping\n(\naddress\n \n=>\n \nuint\n)\n \npublic\n \nbalanceOf\n;\n\n    \nuint\n \npublic\n \ntotalSupply\n;\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \ndeposit\n()\n \npublic\n \npayable\n \n{\n\n        \nbalanceOf\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n+=\n \nmsg\n.\nvalue\n;\n\n        \ntotalSupply\n \n+=\n \nmsg\n.\nvalue\n;\n\n        \nassert\n(\nthis\n.\nbalance\n \n>=\n \ntotalSupply\n);\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the assertion is \nnot\n a strict equality of the balance because the contract can be \nforcibly sent ether\n without going through the \ndeposit()\n function!\n\n\nUse \nassert()\n and \nrequire()\n properly\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn Solidity 0.4.10 \nassert()\n and \nrequire()\n were introduced. \nrequire(condition)\n is meant to be used for input validation, which should be done on any user input, and reverts if the condition is false. \nassert(condition)\n also reverts if the condition is false but should be used only for invariants: internal errors or to check if your contract has reached an invalid state. Following this paradigm allows formal analysis tools to verify that the invalid opcode can never be reached: meaning no invariants in the code are violated and that the code is formally verified.\n\n\nBeware rounding with integer division\n\u00b6\n\n\nAll integer division rounds down to the nearest integer. If you need more precision, consider using a multiplier, or store both the numerator and denominator.\n\n\n(In the future, Solidity will have a fixed-point type, which will make this easier.)\n\n\n// bad\n\n\nuint\n \nx\n \n=\n \n5\n \n/\n \n2\n;\n \n// Result is 2, all integer divison rounds DOWN to the nearest integer\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing a multiplier prevents rounding down, this multiplier needs to be accounted for when working with x in the future:\n\n\n// good\n\n\nuint\n \nmultiplier\n \n=\n \n10\n;\n\n\nuint\n \nx\n \n=\n \n(\n5\n \n*\n \nmultiplier\n)\n \n/\n \n2\n;\n\n\n\n\n\nStoring the numerator and denominator means you can calculate the result of \nnumerator/denominator\n off-chain:\n\n// good\n\n\nuint\n \nnumerator\n \n=\n \n5\n;\n\n\nuint\n \ndenominator\n \n=\n \n2\n;\n\n\n\n\nRemember that Ether can be forcibly sent to an account\n\u00b6\n\n\nBeware of coding an invariant that strictly checks the balance of a contract.\n\n\nAn attacker can forcibly send wei to any account and this cannot be prevented (not even with a fallback function that does a \nrevert()\n).\n\n\nThe attacker can do this by creating a contract, funding it with 1 wei, and invoking\n\nselfdestruct(victimAddress)\n.  No code is invoked in \nvictimAddress\n, so it\ncannot be prevented.\n\n\nDon't assume contracts are created with zero balance\n\u00b6\n\n\nAn attacker can send wei to the address of a contract before it is created.  Contracts should not assume that its initial state contains a zero balance.  See \nissue 61\n for more details.\n\n\nRemember that on-chain data is public\n\u00b6\n\n\nMany applications require submitted data to be private up until some point in time in order to work. Games (eg. on-chain rock-paper-scissors) and auction mechanisms (eg. sealed-bid second-price auctions) are two major categories of examples. If you are building an application where privacy is an issue, take care to avoid requiring users to publish information too early.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\n\nIn rock paper scissors, require both players to submit a hash of their intended move first, then require both players to submit their move; if the submitted move does not match the hash throw it out.\n\n\nIn an auction, require players to submit a hash of their bid value in an initial phase (along with a deposit greater than their bid value), and then submit their action bid value in the second phase.\n\n\nWhen developing an application that depends on a random number generator, the order should always be (1) players submit moves, (2) random number generated, (3) players paid out. The method by which random numbers are generated is itself an area of active research; current best-in-class solutions include Bitcoin block headers (verified through \nhttp://btcrelay.org\n), hash-commit-reveal schemes (ie. one party generates a number, publishes its hash to \"commit\" to the value, and then reveals the value later) and \nRANDAO\n.\n\n\nIf you are implementing a frequent batch auction, a hash-commit scheme is also desirable.\n\n\n\n\nBe aware of the tradeoffs between abstract contracts and interfaces\n\u00b6\n\n\nBoth interfaces and abstract contracts provide one with a customizable and re-usable approach for smart contracts. Interfaces, which were introduced in Solidity 0.4.11, are similar to abstract contracts but cannot have any functions implemented. Interfaces also have limitations such as not being able to access storage or inherit from other interfaces which generally makes abstract contracts more practical. Although, Interfaces are certainly useful for designing contracts prior to implementation. Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that if a contract inherits from an abstract contract it must implement all non-implemented functions via overriding or it will be abstract as well.\n\n\nIn 2-party or N-party contracts, beware of the possibility that some participants may \"drop offline\" and not return\n\u00b6\n\n\nDo not make refund or claim processes dependent on a specific party performing a particular action with no other way of getting the funds out. For example, in a rock-paper-scissors game, one common mistake is to not make a payout until both players submit their moves; however, a malicious player can \"grief\" the other by simply never submitting their move - in fact, if a player sees the other player's revealed move and determines that they lost, they have no reason to submit their own move at all. This issue may also arise in the context of state channel settlement. When such situations are an issue, (1) provide a way of circumventing non-participating participants, perhaps through a time limit, and (2) consider adding an additional economic incentive for participants to submit information in all of the situations in which they are supposed to do so.\n\n\nKeep fallback functions simple\n\u00b6\n\n\nFallback functions\n are called when a contract is sent a message with no arguments (or when no function matches), and only has access to 2,300 gas when called from a \n.send()\n or \n.transfer()\n. If you wish to be able to receive Ether from a \n.send()\n or \n.transfer()\n, the most you can do in a fallback function is log an event. Use a proper function if a computation or more gas is required.\n\n\n// bad\n\n\nfunction\n()\n \npayable\n \n{\n \nbalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n+=\n \nmsg\n.\nvalue\n;\n \n}\n\n\n\n// good\n\n\nfunction\n \ndeposit\n()\n \npayable\n \nexternal\n \n{\n \nbalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n+=\n \nmsg\n.\nvalue\n;\n \n}\n\n\n\nfunction\n()\n \npayable\n \n{\n \nLogDepositReceived\n(\nmsg\n.\nsender\n);\n \n}\n\n\n\n\n\nExplicitly mark visibility in functions and state variables\n\u00b6\n\n\nExplicitly label the visibility of functions and state variables.

Examples:   In rock paper scissors, require both players to submit a hash of their intended move first, then require both players to submit their move; if the submitted move does not match the hash throw it out.  In an auction, require players to submit a hash of their bid value in an initial phase (along with a deposit greater than their bid value), and then submit their action bid value in the second phase.  When developing an application that depends on a random number generator, the order should always be (1) players submit moves, (2) random number generated, (3) players paid out. The method by which random numbers are generated is itself an area of active research; current best-in-class solutions include Bitcoin block headers (verified through  http://btcrelay.org ), hash-commit-reveal schemes (ie. one party generates a number, publishes its hash to \"commit\" to the value, and then reveals the value later) and  RANDAO .

This class of bug can take many forms, and both of the major bugs that led to the DAO's collapse were bugs of this sort.\n\n\nReentrancy\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe first version of this bug to be noticed involved functions that could be called repeatedly, before the first invocation of the function was finished. This may cause the different invocations of the function to interact in destructive ways.\n\n\n// INSECURE\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=>\n \nuint\n)\n \nprivate\n \nuserBalances\n;\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nwithdrawBalance\n()\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \nuint\n \namountToWithdraw\n \n=\n \nuserBalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n];\n\n    \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\nsender\n.\ncall\n.\nvalue\n(\namountToWithdraw\n)());\n \n// At this point, the caller's code is executed, and can call withdrawBalance again\n\n    \nuserBalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n=\n \n0\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the user's balance is not set to 0 until the very end of the function, the second (and later) invocations will still succeed, and will withdraw the balance over and over again. A very similar bug was one of the vulnerabilities in the DAO attack.\n\n\nIn the example given, the best way to avoid the problem is to \nuse \nsend()\n instead of \ncall.value()()\n. This will prevent any external code from being executed.\n\n\nHowever, if you can't remove the external call, the next simplest way to prevent this attack is to make sure you don't call an external function until you've done all the internal work you need to do:\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=>\n \nuint\n)\n \nprivate\n \nuserBalances\n;\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nwithdrawBalance\n()\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \nuint\n \namountToWithdraw\n \n=\n \nuserBalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n];\n\n    \nuserBalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n=\n \n0\n;\n\n    \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\nsender\n.\ncall\n.\nvalue\n(\namountToWithdraw\n)());\n \n// The user's balance is already 0, so future invocations won't withdraw anything\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that if you had another function which called \nwithdrawBalance()\n, it would be potentially subject to the same attack, so you must treat any function which calls an untrusted contract as itself untrusted. See below for further discussion of potential solutions.\n\n\nCross-function Race Conditions\n\u00b6\n\n\nAn attacker may also be able to do a similar attack using two different functions that share the same state.\n\n\n// INSECURE\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=>\n \nuint\n)\n \nprivate\n \nuserBalances\n;\n\n\n\nfunction\n \ntransfer\n(\naddress\n \nto\n,\n \nuint\n \namount\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nif\n \n(\nuserBalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n>=\n \namount\n)\n \n{\n\n       \nuserBalances\n[\nto\n]\n \n+=\n \namount\n;\n\n       \nuserBalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n-=\n \namount\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nwithdrawBalance\n()\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \nuint\n \namountToWithdraw\n \n=\n \nuserBalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n];\n\n    \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\nsender\n.\ncall\n.\nvalue\n(\namountToWithdraw\n)());\n \n// At this point, the caller's code is executed, and can call transfer()\n\n    \nuserBalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n=\n \n0\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, the attacker calls \ntransfer()\n when their code is executed on the external call in \nwithdrawBalance\n.

However, there is still the fundamental feature of logically distinct processes contending for resources, and the same sorts of pitfalls and potential solutions apply.\n\n\n\nTransaction-Ordering Dependence (TOD) / Front Running\n\u00b6\n\n\nAbove were examples of race conditions involving the attacker executing malicious code \nwithin a single transaction\n. The following are a different type of race condition inherent to Blockchains: the fact that \nthe order of transactions themselves\n (within a block) is easily subject to manipulation.\n\n\nSince a transaction is in the mempool for a short while, one can know what actions will occur, before it is included in a block. This can be troublesome for things like decentralized markets, where a transaction to buy some tokens can be seen, and a market order implemented before the other transaction gets included. Protecting against this is difficult, as it would come down to the specific contract itself. For example, in markets, it would be better to implement batch auctions (this also protects against high frequency trading concerns). Another way to use a pre-commit scheme (\u201cI\u2019m going to submit the details later\u201d).\n\n\nTimestamp Dependence\n\u00b6\n\n\nBe aware that the timestamp of the block can be manipulated by the miner, and all direct and indirect uses of the timestamp should be considered. \nBlock numbers\n and \naverage block time\n can be used to estimate time, but this is not future proof as block times may change (such as the changes expected during Casper).\n\n\nuint\n \nsomeVariable\n \n=\n \nnow\n \n+\n \n1\n;\n\n\n\nif\n \n(\nnow\n \n%\n \n2\n \n==\n \n0\n)\n \n{\n \n// the now can be manipulated by the miner\n\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nif\n \n((\nsomeVariable\n \n-\n \n100\n)\n \n%\n \n2\n \n==\n \n0\n)\n \n{\n \n// someVariable can be manipulated by the miner\n\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nInteger Overflow and Underflow\n\u00b6\n\n\nBe aware there are around \n20 cases for overflow and underflow\n.\n\n\nConsider a simple token transfer:\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=>\n \nuint256\n)\n \npublic\n \nbalanceOf\n;\n\n\n\n// INSECURE\n\n\nfunction\n \ntransfer\n(\naddress\n \n_to\n,\n \nuint256\n \n_value\n)\n \n{\n\n    \n/* Check if sender has balance */\n\n    \nrequire\n(\nbalanceOf\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n>=\n \n_value\n);\n\n    \n/* Add and subtract new balances */\n\n    \nbalanceOf\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n-=\n \n_value\n;\n\n    \nbalanceOf\n[\n_to\n]\n \n+=\n \n_value\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n// SECURE\n\n\nfunction\n \ntransfer\n(\naddress\n \n_to\n,\n \nuint256\n \n_value\n)\n \n{\n\n    \n/* Check if sender has balance and for overflows */\n\n    \nrequire\n(\nbalanceOf\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n>=\n \n_value\n \n&&\n \nbalanceOf\n[\n_to\n]\n \n+\n \n_value\n \n>=\n \nbalanceOf\n[\n_to\n]);\n\n\n    \n/* Add and subtract new balances */\n\n    \nbalanceOf\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n-=\n \n_value\n;\n\n    \nbalanceOf\n[\n_to\n]\n \n+=\n \n_value\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a balance reaches the maximum uint value (2^256) it will circle back to zero. This checks for that condition. This may or may not be relevant, depending on the implementation. Think about whether or not the uint value has an opportunity to approach such a large number. Think about how the uint variable changes state, and who has authority to make such changes. If any user can call functions which update the uint value, it's more vulnerable to attack. If only an admin has access to change the variable's state, you might be safe. If a user can increment by only 1 at a time, you are probably also safe because there is no feasible way to reach this limit.\n\n\nThe same is true for underflow. If a uint is made to be less than zero, it will cause an underflow and get set to its maximum value.\n\n\nBe careful with the smaller data-types like uint8, uint16, uint24...etc: they can even more easily hit their maximum value.\n\n\nBe aware there are around \n20 cases for overflow and underflow\n.\n\n\n\n\nDoS with (Unexpected) revert\n\u00b6\n\n\nConsider a simple auction contract:\n\n\n// INSECURE\n\n\ncontract\n \nAuction\n \n{\n\n    \naddress\n \ncurrentLeader\n;\n\n    \nuint\n \nhighestBid\n;\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nbid\n()\n \npayable\n \n{\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\nvalue\n \n>\n \nhighestBid\n);\n\n\n        \nrequire\n(\ncurrentLeader\n.\nsend\n(\nhighestBid\n));\n \n// Refund the old leader, if it fails then revert\n\n\n        \ncurrentLeader\n \n=\n \nmsg\n.\nsender\n;\n\n        \nhighestBid\n \n=\n \nmsg\n.\nvalue\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it tries to refund the old leader, it reverts if the refund fails. This means that a malicious bidder can become the leader while making sure that any refunds to their address will \nalways\n fail. In this way, they can prevent anyone else from calling the \nbid()\n function, and stay the leader forever. A recommendation is to set up a \npull payment system\n instead, as described earlier.\n\n\nAnother example is when a contract may iterate through an array to pay users (e.g., supporters in a crowdfunding contract). It's common to want to make sure that each payment succeeds. If not, one should revert. The issue is that if one call fails, you are reverting the whole payout system, meaning the loop will never complete. No one gets paid because one address is forcing an error.\n\n\naddress\n[]\n \nprivate\n \nrefundAddresses\n;\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=>\n \nuint\n)\n \npublic\n \nrefunds\n;\n\n\n\n// bad\n\n\nfunction\n \nrefundAll\n()\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \nfor\n(\nuint\n \nx\n;\n \nx\n \n<\n \nrefundAddresses\n.\nlength\n;\n \nx\n++\n)\n \n{\n \n// arbitrary length iteration based on how many addresses participated\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nrefundAddresses\n[\nx\n].\nsend\n(\nrefunds\n[\nrefundAddresses\n[\nx\n]]))\n \n// doubly bad, now a single failure on send will hold up all funds\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, the recommended solution is to \nfavor pull over push payments\n.\n\n\nDoS with Block Gas Limit\n\u00b6\n\n\nYou may have noticed another problem with the previous example: by paying out to everyone at once, you risk running into the block gas limit. Each Ethereum block can process a certain maximum amount of computation. If you try to go over that, your transaction will fail.\n\n\nThis can lead to problems even in the absence of an intentional attack. However, it's especially bad if an attacker can manipulate the amount of gas needed. In the case of the previous example, the attacker could add a bunch of addresses, each of which needs to get a very small refund. The gas cost of refunding each of the attacker's addresses could, therefore, end up being more than the gas limit, blocking the refund transaction from happening at all.\n\n\nThis is another reason to \nfavor pull over push payments\n.\n\n\nIf you absolutely must loop over an array of unknown size, then you should plan for it to potentially take multiple blocks, and therefore require multiple transactions. You will need to keep track of how far you've gone, and be able to resume from that point, as in the following example:\n\n\nstruct\n \nPayee\n \n{\n\n    \naddress\n \naddr\n;\n\n    \nuint256\n \nvalue\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\nPayee\n \npayees\n[];\n\n\nuint256\n \nnextPayeeIndex\n;\n\n\n\nfunction\n \npayOut\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nuint256\n \ni\n \n=\n \nnextPayeeIndex\n;\n\n    \nwhile\n \n(\ni\n \n<\n \npayees\n.\nlength\n \n&&\n \nmsg\n.\ngas\n \n>\n \n200000\n)\n \n{\n\n      \npayees\n[\ni\n].\naddr\n.\nsend\n(\npayees\n[\ni\n].\nvalue\n);\n\n      \ni\n++\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n    \nnextPayeeIndex\n \n=\n \ni\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will need to make sure that nothing bad will happen if other transactions are processed while waiting for the next iteration of the \npayOut()\n function. So only use this pattern if absolutely necessary.\n\n\nCall Depth Attack\n\u00b6\n\n\nAs of the \nEIP 150\n hardfork, call depth attacks are no longer relevant\n*\n (all gas would be consumed well before reaching the 1024 call depth limit).",

The following are a different type of race condition inherent to Blockchains: the fact that  the order of transactions themselves  (within a block) is easily subject to manipulation.  Since a transaction is in the mempool for a short while, one can know what actions will occur, before it is included in a block. This can be troublesome for things like decentralized markets, where a transaction to buy some tokens can be seen, and a market order implemented before the other transaction gets included. Protecting against this is difficult, as it would come down to the specific contract itself. For example, in markets, it would be better to implement batch auctions (this also protects against high frequency trading concerns). Another way to use a pre-commit scheme (\u201cI\u2019m going to submit the details later\u201d).",

This checks for that condition. This may or may not be relevant, depending on the implementation. Think about whether or not the uint value has an opportunity to approach such a large number. Think about how the uint variable changes state, and who has authority to make such changes. If any user can call functions which update the uint value, it's more vulnerable to attack. If only an admin has access to change the variable's state, you might be safe. If a user can increment by only 1 at a time, you are probably also safe because there is no feasible way to reach this limit.  The same is true for underflow. If a uint is made to be less than zero, it will cause an underflow and get set to its maximum value.  Be careful with the smaller data-types like uint8, uint16, uint24...etc: they can even more easily hit their maximum value.  Be aware there are around  20 cases for overflow and underflow .",

This means that a malicious bidder can become the leader while making sure that any refunds to their address will  always  fail. In this way, they can prevent anyone else from calling the  bid()  function, and stay the leader forever. A recommendation is to set up a  pull payment system  instead, as described earlier.  Another example is when a contract may iterate through an array to pay users (e.g., supporters in a crowdfunding contract). It's common to want to make sure that each payment succeeds. If not, one should revert. The issue is that if one call fails, you are reverting the whole payout system, meaning the loop will never complete.

            "text": "You may have noticed another problem with the previous example: by paying out to everyone at once, you risk running into the block gas limit. Each Ethereum block can process a certain maximum amount of computation. If you try to go over that, your transaction will fail.  This can lead to problems even in the absence of an intentional attack. However, it's especially bad if an attacker can manipulate the amount of gas needed. In the case of the previous example, the attacker could add a bunch of addresses, each of which needs to get a very small refund. The gas cost of refunding each of the attacker's addresses could, therefore, end up being more than the gas limit, blocking the refund transaction from happening at all.  This is another reason to  favor pull over push payments .  If you absolutely must loop over an array of unknown size, then you should plan for it to potentially take multiple blocks, and therefore require multiple transactions. You will need to keep track of how far you've gone, and be able to resume from that point, as in the following example:  struct   Payee   { \n     address   addr ; \n     uint256   value ;  }  Payee   payees [];  uint256   nextPayeeIndex ;  function   payOut ()   { \n     uint256   i   =   nextPayeeIndex ; \n     while   ( i   <   payees . length   &&   msg . gas   >   200000 )   { \n       payees [ i ]. addr . send ( payees [ i ]. value ); \n       i ++ ; \n     } \n     nextPayeeIndex   =   i ;  }   You will need to make sure that nothing bad will happen if other transactions are processed while waiting for the next iteration of the  payOut()  function.

Since the cost of failure on a blockchain can be very high, you must also adapt the way you write software, to account for that risk.\n\n\nThe approach we advocate is to \"prepare for failure\". It is impossible to know in advance whether your code is secure. However, you can architect your contracts in a way that allows them to fail gracefully, and with minimal damage. This section presents a variety of techniques that will help you prepare for failure.\n\n\nNote: There's always a risk when you add a new component to your system. A badly designed fail-safe could itself become a vulnerability - as can the interaction between a number of well designed fail-safes. Be thoughtful about each technique you use in your contracts, and consider carefully how they work together to create a robust system.\n\n\nUpgrading Broken Contracts\n\u00b6\n\n\nCode will need to be changed if errors are discovered or if improvements need to be made. It is no good to discover a bug, but have no way to deal with it.\n\n\nDesigning an effective upgrade system for smart contracts is an area of active research, and we won't be able to cover all of the complications in this document. However, there are two basic approaches that are most commonly used. The simpler of the two is to have a registry contract that holds the address of the latest version of the contract. A more seamless approach for contract users is to have a contract that forwards calls and data onto the latest version of the contract.\n\n\nWhatever the technique, it's important to have modularization and good separation between components, so that code changes do not break functionality, orphan data, or require substantial costs to port. In particular, it is usually beneficial to separate complex logic from your data storage, so that you do not have to recreate all of the data in order to change the functionality.\n\n\nIt's also critical to have a secure way for parties to decide to upgrade the code. Depending on your contract, code changes may need to be approved by a single trusted party, a group of members, or a vote of the full set of stakeholders. If this process can take some time, you will want to consider if there are other ways to react more quickly in case of an attack, such as an \nemergency stop or circuit-breaker\n.\n\n\nExample 1: Use a registry contract to store latest version of a contract\n\n\nIn this example, the calls aren't forwarded, so users should fetch the current address each time before interacting with it.\n\n\ncontract\n \nSomeRegister\n \n{\n\n    \naddress\n \nbackendContract\n;\n\n    \naddress\n[]\n \npreviousBackends\n;\n\n    \naddress\n \nowner\n;\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nSomeRegister\n()\n \n{\n\n        \nowner\n \n=\n \nmsg\n.\nsender\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nmodifier\n \nonlyOwner\n()\n \n{\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\nsender\n \n==\n \nowner\n)\n\n        \n_\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nchangeBackend\n(\naddress\n \nnewBackend\n)\n \npublic\n\n    \nonlyOwner\n()\n\n    \nreturns\n \n(\nbool\n)\n\n    \n{\n\n        \nif\n(\nnewBackend\n \n!=\n \nbackendContract\n)\n \n{\n\n            \npreviousBackends\n.\npush\n(\nbackendContract\n);\n\n            \nbackendContract\n \n=\n \nnewBackend\n;\n\n            \nreturn\n \ntrue\n;\n\n        \n}\n\n\n        \nreturn\n \nfalse\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two main disadvantages to this approach:\n\n\n\n\nUsers must always look up the current address, and anyone who fails to do so risks using an old version of the contract\n\n\nYou will need to think carefully about how to deal with the contract data when you replace the contract\n\n\n\n\nThe alternate approach is to have a contract forward calls and data to the latest version of the contract:\n\n\nExample 2: \nUse a \nDELEGATECALL\n to forward data and calls\n\n\ncontract\n \nRelay\n \n{\n\n    \naddress\n \npublic\n \ncurrentVersion\n;\n\n    \naddress\n \npublic\n \nowner\n;\n\n\n    \nmodifier\n \nonlyOwner\n()\n \n{\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\nsender\n \n==\n \nowner\n);\n\n        \n_\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nRelay\n(\naddress\n \ninitAddr\n)\n \n{\n\n        \ncurrentVersion\n \n=\n \ninitAddr\n;\n\n        \nowner\n \n=\n \nmsg\n.\nsender\n;\n \n// this owner may be another contract with multisig, not a single contract owner\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nchangeContract\n(\naddress\n \nnewVersion\n)\n \npublic\n\n    \nonlyOwner\n()\n\n    \n{\n\n        \ncurrentVersion\n \n=\n \nnewVersion\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nfunction\n()\n \n{\n\n        \nrequire\n(\ncurrentVersion\n.\ndelegatecall\n(\nmsg\n.\ndata\n));\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nThis approach avoids the previous problems but has problems of its own. You must be extremely careful with how you store data in this contract. If your new contract has a different storage layout than the first, your data may end up corrupted. Additionally, this simple version of the pattern cannot return values from functions, only forward them, which limits its applicability. (\nMore complex implementations\n attempt to solve this with in-line assembly code and a registry of return sizes.)\n\n\nRegardless of your approach, it is important to have some way to upgrade your contracts, or they will become unusable when the inevitable bugs are discovered in them.\n\n\nCircuit Breakers (Pause contract functionality)\n\u00b6\n\n\nCircuit breakers stop execution if certain conditions are met, and can be useful when new errors are discovered. For example, most actions may be suspended in a contract if a bug is discovered, and the only action now active is a withdrawal. You can either give certain trusted parties the ability to trigger the circuit breaker or else have programmatic rules that automatically trigger the certain breaker when certain conditions are met.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nbool\n \nprivate\n \nstopped\n \n=\n \nfalse\n;\n\n\naddress\n \nprivate\n \nowner\n;\n\n\n\nmodifier\n \nisAdmin\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\nsender\n \n==\n \nowner\n);\n\n    \n_\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction\n \ntoggleContractActive\n()\n \nisAdmin\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \n// You can add an additional modifier that restricts stopping a contract to be based on another action, such as a vote of users\n\n    \nstopped\n \n=\n \n!\nstopped\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nmodifier\n \nstopInEmergency\n \n{\n \nif\n \n(\n!\nstopped\n)\n \n_\n;\n \n}\n\n\nmodifier\n \nonlyInEmergency\n \n{\n \nif\n \n(\nstopped\n)\n \n_\n;\n \n}\n\n\n\nfunction\n \ndeposit\n()\n \nstopInEmergency\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \n// some code\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nwithdraw\n()\n \nonlyInEmergency\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \n// some code\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeed Bumps (Delay contract actions)\n\u00b6\n\n\nSpeed bumps slow down actions, so that if malicious actions occur, there is time to recover. For example, \nThe DAO\n required 27 days between a successful request to split the DAO and the ability to do so. This ensured the funds were kept within the contract, increasing the likelihood of recovery. In the case of the DAO, there was no effective action that could be taken during the time given by the speed bump, but in combination with our other techniques, they can be quite effective.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nstruct\n \nRequestedWithdrawal\n \n{\n\n    \nuint\n \namount\n;\n\n    \nuint\n \ntime\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=>\n \nuint\n)\n \nprivate\n \nbalances\n;\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=>\n \nRequestedWithdrawal\n)\n \nprivate\n \nrequestedWithdrawals\n;\n\n\nuint\n \nconstant\n \nwithdrawalWaitPeriod\n \n=\n \n28\n \ndays\n;\n \n// 4 weeks\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nrequestWithdrawal\n()\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \nif\n \n(\nbalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n>\n \n0\n)\n \n{\n\n        \nuint\n \namountToWithdraw\n \n=\n \nbalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n];\n\n        \nbalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n=\n \n0\n;\n \n// for simplicity, we withdraw everything;\n\n        \n// presumably, the deposit function prevents new deposits when withdrawals are in progress\n\n\n        \nrequestedWithdrawals\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n=\n \nRequestedWithdrawal\n({\n\n            \namount\n:\n \namountToWithdraw\n,\n\n            \ntime\n:\n \nnow\n\n        \n});\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nwithdraw\n()\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \nif\n(\nrequestedWithdrawals\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n].\namount\n \n>\n \n0\n \n&&\n \nnow\n \n>\n \nrequestedWithdrawals\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n].\ntime\n \n+\n \nwithdrawalWaitPeriod\n)\n \n{\n\n        \nuint\n \namountToWithdraw\n \n=\n \nrequestedWithdrawals\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n].\namount\n;\n\n        \nrequestedWithdrawals\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n].\namount\n \n=\n \n0\n;\n\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\nsender\n.\nsend\n(\namountToWithdraw\n));\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nRate Limiting\n\u00b6\n\n\nRate limiting halts or requires approval for substantial changes. For example, a depositor may only be allowed to withdraw a certain amount or percentage of total deposits over a certain time period (e.g., max 100 ether over 1 day) - additional withdrawals in that time period may fail or require some sort of special approval. Or the rate limit could be at the contract level, with only a certain amount of tokens issued by the contract over a time period.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nContract Rollout\n\u00b6\n\n\nContracts should have a substantial and prolonged testing period - before substantial money is put at risk.\n\n\nAt minimum, you should:\n\n\n\n\nHave a full test suite with 100% test coverage (or close to it)\n\n\nDeploy on your own testnet\n\n\nDeploy on the public testnet with substantial testing and bug bounties\n\n\nExhaustive testing should allow various players to interact with the contract at volume\n\n\nDeploy on the mainnet in beta, with limits to the amount at risk\n\n\n\n\nAutomatic Deprecation\n\u00b6\n\n\nDuring testing, you can force an automatic deprecation by preventing any actions, after a certain time period.

Rewards for minor 'harmless' bugs start at 0.05 BTC. Major bugs, for example leading to consensus issues, will be rewarded up to 5 BTC. Much higher rewards are possible (up to 25 BTC) in case of very severe vulnerabilities.",

Keep bounty participants informed throughout the process, and then strive to avoid delays in sending them their reward   For an example of the three tiers of rewards, see  Ethereum's Bounty Program :   The value of rewards paid out will vary depending on severity of impact. Rewards for minor 'harmless' bugs start at 0.05 BTC. Major bugs, for example leading to consensus issues, will be rewarded up to 5 BTC. Much higher rewards are possible (up to 25 BTC) in case of very severe vulnerabilities.",
